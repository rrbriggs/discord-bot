# discord-bot
Mucking around with creating a discord bot. The main functionality I wanted was to move everyone from a private channel to a public channel.

# Poking fun at users

Bot has a joke functionality !joke

It will pick a person and make a joke about them.
My jokes are just for MMOs at the moment and just make fun of a persons DPS/Tanking/Healing randomly.

A user is selected randomly, each time reducing the chance that they will be made fun of again.

Requires discord.py rewrite branch. (git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py@rewrite#egg=discord.py)
